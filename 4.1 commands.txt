📄 Step 1: Create a Practice File

Run this:

nano practice_logs.txt

Now paste the text below 👇

Save and exit.

🧪 Step 2: Practice grep Commands

Now try these:

🔍 1️⃣ Find all ERROR lines
grep ERROR practice_logs.txt
🔍 2️⃣ Count number of ERROR lines
grep -c ERROR practice_logs.txt
🔍 3️⃣ Case-insensitive search
grep -i warning practice_logs.txt
🔍 4️⃣ Show line numbers
grep -n INFO practice_logs.txt
🔍 5️⃣ Find lines containing both ERROR and database
grep ERROR practice_logs.txt | grep database
🔍 6️⃣ Find lines that start with date 2026-02-25
grep ^2026 practice_logs.txt
🔍 7️⃣ Find usernames
grep username practice_logs.txt
🔍 8️⃣ Find lines ending with "successfully"
grep successfully$ practice_logs.txt
🔥 Advanced Practice (For DevOps Level)

Try:

grep -E "ERROR|WARNING" practice_logs.txt
grep -v INFO practice_logs.txt
grep -i docker practice_logs.txt
🎯 If You Want More Challenge

I can generate:

Apache access logs

Kubernetes pod logs

Systemd logs

Mixed structured data

Large dataset for regex practice

Tell me what level you want 😎

kubernetes pod logs

Perfect 😎🔥
Since you're learning Kubernetes seriously, here is a realistic Kubernetes pod log file for grep practice.

📄 Step 1: Create a File
nano k8s_pod_logs.txt

Now paste this 👇

🧪 Practice grep Commands
🔍 1️⃣ Find all ERROR logs
grep ERROR k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔍 2️⃣ Count total ERROR logs
grep -c ERROR k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔍 3️⃣ Show only payment-service logs
grep payment-service k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔍 4️⃣ Find logs related to database
grep -i database k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔍 5️⃣ Show logs with ERROR or WARNING
grep -E "ERROR|WARNING" k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔍 6️⃣ Exclude INFO logs
grep -v INFO k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔍 7️⃣ Find logs for a specific user
grep user=admin k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔍 8️⃣ Show line numbers with errors
grep -n ERROR k8s_pod_logs.txt
🔥 DevOps-Level Challenge

Try extracting only service names:

grep ERROR k8s_pod_logs.txt | grep -o "\[.*\]"

Or find exceptions:

grep Exception k8s_pod_logs.txt
